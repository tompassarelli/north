#!/usr/bin/env bash
# tripwire-guard.sh — PreToolUse deny-hook (Bash tool ONLY; Edit/Write have domain guards).
# =============================================================================
# PreToolUse hooks fire even under --dangerously-skip-permissions, so this
# file is the explicit, versioned safety layer for unattended agents running
# with bypassPermissions.
#
# DENY (exit 2 + one-line stderr reason) ONLY these classes; everything else
# exits 0 fast:
#   1. Recursive deletes judged by WHAT WOULD BE LOST, not by where the path is:
#      rm -r (any flag order, incl. --recursive), find … -delete, git clean -f.
#      Each target is classified once (classify_delete_target) into one of:
#        never    — /, $HOME, a system root, a personal category root, /tmp
#                   itself, or an unguarded `$VAR` target whose unset expansion
#                   IS a root delete. HARD in every mode, no ask.
#        sacred   — someone else's or the machine's: a `main/` checkout, a
#                   project container under ~/code, a container's `worktrees/`
#                   or `pins/` collection root, any `pins/<full-object-id>`
#                   (raw deletion is forbidden; verified orphan retirement uses
#                   `pin-retire`), ~/code/*-data,
#                   ~/.local/state/north, ~/code/resources, a
#                   `worktrees/<slug>` lane this session is not working in, any
#                   `.git`, any checkout root. HARD in every mode, no ask.
#        gone     — the path does not exist: nothing to lose. ALLOW.
#        regen    — provably regenerable: $XDG_CACHE_HOME, /tmp/*, /var/tmp,
#                   $TMPDIR/*, /run/user/*, node_modules/__pycache__/&c, and
#                   anything git itself declares ignored. ALLOW.
#        tracked  — inside a repo with nothing untracked or modified under it:
#                   git restores it. ALLOW.
#        dirty    — inside a repo, but untracked/modified content under the
#                   target that git cannot restore. Ask/deny.
#        personal — under $HOME, no version control, no cache: ask/deny.
#        unknown  — unclassifiable: ask/deny (blocking is the safe default).
#      MODE-AWARE, for the ask/deny tiers ONLY: in an INTERACTIVE session
#      (permission_mode ∈ default/acceptEdits/plan) they become a permission ASK
#      (stdout ask envelope, exit 0); unattended (bypassPermissions, or a
#      missing/empty/unknown permission_mode — old harness or SDK-dispatched
#      lane) fails CLOSED to the hard deny, and the reason names
#      `north config guards off` as the deliberate path. never/sacred are HARD
#      in every mode. Asks ACCUMULATE, they do not exit — a later hard-deny
#      class in the same command (e.g. `rm -rf ~/x && git push -f`) still wins
#      (exit 2); the ask envelope emits only after the full walk with asks
#      pending and no hard deny. Classes 2-5 below are hard denies in EVERY mode.
#      PROPORTIONALITY: a bounded `find … -type f -mtime +N -delete` and an
#      `rm -rf` of the same directory are both blocked, but the reason says
#      which one it is — the friction should read as sized to the act.
#   2. Force-push / history rewrite: git push with -f/--force/--force-with-lease/
#      --mirror/--delete/--prune; and raw `git push` (house policy: safe-push
#      only). safe-push's inner push exports SAFE_PUSH_ACTIVE=1 → allowed.
#   3. Credential exfil surface: a secret-ish path (.ssh/, .aws/ — incl. the
#      bare dirs ~/.ssh ~/.aws — *_SECRET*, *.pem, id_rsa/id_ed25519/id_ecdsa,
#      .config/sops, /run/secrets, *.age)
#      AND a network verb (curl/wget/nc/ncat/netcat) in the SAME command,
#      non-localhost; PLUS ssh in the pipe-in shape ONLY — a secret path in an
#      earlier PIPE stage (`secret … | ssh host …`) feeding ssh's stdin.
#      Plain local reads of secret paths: ALLOWED — the tripwire is the exfil
#      COMBINATION. ssh/scp `-i <keyfile>` is authentication, not exfil: the
#      token after -i is excluded from the secret scan. Secrets in ssh's OWN
#      args (a remote read like `ssh box 'grep X_SECRET .env'`) stay ALLOWED —
#      only local material piped INTO ssh trips (see the ssh dispatch note).
#   4. Outbound uploads: curl/wget with -T/--upload-file/-d @f/--data-binary @f/
#      -F x=@f/--post-file to non-localhost; scp/rsync ONLY when a SOURCE is a
#      secret-ish path and the DESTINATION (last non-flag arg) is a remote,
#      non-localhost host. Non-secret scp/rsync uploads are ALLOWED (see the
#      ssh dispatch note): `scp f box:` moves the bytes the allowed
#      `ssh box 'cat > f' < f` already moves, so a destination allowlist would
#      only tax the honest path.
#   5. Destructive system ops: mkfs*, dd of=/dev/* (except null/stdout/stderr),
#      shutdown/reboot/poweroff/halt, systemctl power subcommands,
#      chmod -R 000, chown -R root. Service lifecycle operations are allowed;
#      authorization for them belongs to the task, not this lexical guard.
#
# Design constraints honored:
#   - pure bash + coreutils; jq only on the slow path for correct JSON string
#     decode (NO python — this runs on EVERY Bash call). Fork budget: fast path
#     0 forks (case-glob prescreen), slow path 2 (jq). A class-1 target adds one
#     `realpath -sm`, and only if the fork-free tiers (never / sacred / gone /
#     scratch) all decline does it ask git: `rev-parse`, then `check-ignore`,
#     then a PATH-SCOPED `status --porcelain` — the enumeration is bounded by
#     the target, and the ignored case (node_modules and friends) never reaches
#     the status call.
#   - FAIL-OPEN on anything unparseable — this is a tripwire for clear
#     destructive patterns, not a general classifier. Deliberate accepted
#     misses: `bash -c "…"`/xargs indirection, and find with \( \) grouping (the
#     grouped -delete lands in another segment). A $VAR delete target is NOT a
#     miss any more — it is class 1's unguarded-variable deny.
#   - Every DENY is (1) appended to ~/.local/state/north/tripwire.log (ISO ts <TAB>
#     cwd <TAB> reason <TAB> command head) so north-mine can audit, AND (2) routed
#     through the guard_denial fact idiom (sdk/src/guard-log.ts): a titleless
#     @denial:<agent>-<ts> subject, kind=guard_denial + agent/guard/tool/target/reason/at
#     + source=tripwire — so the block is ATTRIBUTED (which agent) and queryable off the
#     graph, not just a loose unattributed TSV line. Fire-and-forget + detached: a
#     fact-write failure NEVER delays or breaks the DENY; the file line stays regardless.
#   - The interactive class-1 ASK writes an "ask: <reason>" line to the same
#     tripwire.log for audit but does NOT route through record_denial_fact — an
#     ask is not a denial; the guard_denial graph idiom stays denial-only.
#
