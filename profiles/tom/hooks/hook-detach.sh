# Fire-and-forget wrapper for post-hoc telemetry hooks.
#
# PostToolUse hooks run AFTER the tool has already executed. Nothing downstream
# consumes their result, so blocking the agent on them buys exactly nothing —
# but the agent pays the full latency on every single tool call.
#
# Measured 2026-07-29 (3 runs, this machine): north-on-tooluse cost 2132 ms
# synchronously, against 9-11 ms for each guard and 99 ms for logcompress. It
# was ~94% of all hook time in a session; a 200-call session spent ~7 minutes
# waiting on telemetry it never read.
#
# This wrapper drains stdin (the hook payload), hands it to the real hook in a
# detached session, and returns immediately. Guards must NEVER be wrapped in
# this — a guard's verdict is the whole point of running it synchronously.
#
# Usage in a hooks config:
#   hook-detach.sh <real-hook> [args...]
