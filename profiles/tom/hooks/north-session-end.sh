# The generation-owned north-on-spawn wrapper does NOT persist the agent id — it
# derives it deterministically as ${NORTH_AGENT_ID:-cc-<repo>-<session_id[:8]>}
# from the (NORTH_AGENT_ID primary; TERN_AGENT_ID accepted as transitional
# fallback) session_id + cwd that Claude Code also hands this hook on stdin.
# We mirror that derivation EXACTLY, so no spawn-side change (and no state
# file) is needed.
#
# Presence heartbeat death is handled elsewhere: it lapses on its own when the
# session process exits, and a separate change hides stale-heartbeat concerns from
# `concern ls` (that path covers crashes/kills). This hook only accelerates the
# CLEAN-exit case. Best-effort throughout: never block exit, never emit stdout.
