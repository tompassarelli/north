"""The guard must refuse the Bash calls that actually breached the primaries.

Every DENY case below is a verbatim command shape an agent ran against a
launch-critical primary on 2026-07-29 while the guard was live and wired. None
of them fired, because the guard only inspected `tool_input.file_path`, which a
Bash call does not have. These cases exist so that hole cannot reopen.

The ALLOW cases matter just as much: a guard that also blocks reads, or blocks
`git worktree add` — the very escape route its deny message recommends — traps
the agent with no compliant move, and the next person turns the guard off.
