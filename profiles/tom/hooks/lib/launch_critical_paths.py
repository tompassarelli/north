The slot directly under the container carries the lifecycle policy. Lane leaf
names carry none; a pin leaf additionally carries the checkout's full object
identity. `worktrees` and `pins` are matched POSITIONALLY at container depth,
never anywhere in the path — `main/docs/worktrees/x.md` is repository content,
not a lane.

EVERY `main` checkout under ~/code is protected, not only the launch-critical
ones: `main` is never edited in place anywhere, and dirty state there is the
human's. Detection is dynamic — an ancestor directory named `main` holding a
`.git` — so a project is covered the day it is cloned. Client repos nest
(~/code/client/<owner>/<project>/main) and fall out of the same rule.
