"""Decide whether one tool call writes into a protected checkout.

TWO PROTECTED SHAPES, TWO REMEDIES

A `main/` checkout is protected because it is the clean product and any dirt in
it is the human's; the remedy is a lane under `<container>/worktrees/`. A
`pins/<full-object-id>/` checkout is protected because something OUTSIDE the repository
consumes that immutable commit at that exact path. The remedy is a new
hash-named pin plus a consumer update, never mutation of the existing checkout.
`protected_project` returns the kind so both nouns and both remedies stay
correct at every deny site.

BASH COVERAGE

`tool_input.file_path` exists only for Edit/Write/MultiEdit. A Bash call
carries `tool_input.command` instead, so this module parses Bash commands
(git verbs, redirects, in-place/destination-taking commands, interpreter
heredocs) to catch writes that route through the shell rather than a
file_path.

APPLY_PATCH

apply_patch carries Add/Update/Delete File targets and Move to destinations
inside its patch envelope. Both direct tool calls and Bash string/argv entrances
are parsed.

READ vs WRITE

Reads from a primary stay allowed — `git log`, `git status`, `grep`, `cat`. So
does the sanctioned escape route the deny message itself recommends:
`git worktree add` (into `<container>/worktrees/`) and
`git fetch LANE BRANCH:refs/heads/main`. Pin contents and HEAD have no sanctioned
mutation: a new full-object-ID pin is created when a consumer advances.

WIP DESTRUCTION

A separate, louder class: `reset --hard`, `stash`, `checkout -- <path>`,
`restore`, `clean -f` against a main checkout throw away uncommitted work that
is the human's, not the lane's. It is checked across EVERY git call in the
command, so a sanctioned verb earlier in the line cannot shield it.

SANCTIONED TOOLS

`wt-rescue` is the remediation this guard's deny message recommends, and it
performs internally the very operations denied raw. Its own command segment is
excised before any rule runs; every other segment on the line is still scanned.

FAIL-OPEN for unparseable commands, unknown shapes, and internal exceptions. A
recognized apply_patch call whose envelope cannot be parsed is denied: it is a
write, and a write whose targets cannot be read cannot be checked.
