#   1. It denies writes to the PRIMARY checkout of a launch-critical repo.
#   2. It never denies anything else — a guard that blocks ordinary work gets
#      switched off, and then it protects nothing. The worktree cases and the
#      ~/code/north-data sibling are the ones that would regress in practice.

# nothing and stopped agents writing docs/private/ notes — which is exactly
