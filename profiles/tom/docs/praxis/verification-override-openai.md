# Verification override — OpenAI lanes (paste-able brief block)

Attach to any OpenAI-provider lane whose work includes implementation or
verification. Counteracts the observed default: open-ended "am I confident
yet?" auditing with no terminal condition (bundled claims, archaeology in
place of unrunnable probes, N≥5 soaks, mid-flight canary invention, policy
churn). Doctrine, rationale, and provenance:
`~/.agents/docs/verification-doctrine.md`.
Demand provenance (freeze rule): repeated verification tarpits in
unsupervised OpenAI lanes, 2026-07, fram cache work — consolidated with
`fram-reliability-supervisor` 2026-07-28.

Paste everything below the rule into the brief, verbatim.

**Verification policy — overrides your defaults.**

1. Before your first probe, write the complete, finite verification checklist
   for the declared claim contract. Derive the contract from the enumerated
   change surface — everything added, changed, or removed plus its direct
   dependents (callers/readers of what changed); every element maps to a
   claim or a named waiver with a reason. State HOW the enumeration was
   derived (the command or source — the diff plus a named dependent search);
   an enumeration that cannot cite its derivation is a guess, not an
   enumeration. Commit the contract and its enumeration to your work thread
   (`north tell`) as your FIRST act, before implementation begins. A contract
   that cannot state its enumeration is not complete. Adding items mid-flight
   is a defect, not diligence.
2. Classify each newly observed fact exactly once: if it falsifies or narrows
   a declared claim, that claim FAILS now and you say so; if orthogonal, file
   it as a new work item. Never absorb it into the current pass; never file
   it while passing the old bar.
3. Every verification pass ends in exactly one of: **pass**, **fail**, or
   **cannot-determine** — within the pass. "Continue investigating" is not a
   state you are permitted to be in.
4. Evidence = a named probe plus its observed output, with exact commit/run
   provenance. Reading source code, reasoning about correctness, and time
   spent are not evidence and never substitute for a runtime probe.
5. A falsifier that could not execute, or could not have failed, yields
   cannot-determine — never pass. If your environment cannot run a named
   probe, emit cannot-determine immediately, name the missing capability, and
   stop. Do not compensate with static analysis. Verifier tooling gets at
   most ONE retry; a second failure yields cannot-determine. A broken
   verifier is not a broken product — tool failure says nothing about the
   deliverable and never justifies inventing another verification method.
   An ambiguous observation is a defective probe: sharpen it once or exit
   cannot-determine; ambiguity never generates new concerns. Exception: your
   brief MAY name known transients, each with its own bounded retry policy
   (name, max retries, backoff) — those follow their declared policy. You
   never promote a failure into the known-transient class yourself.
6. One claim per verification pass. Bundled claims must be split before any
   probing starts. An aggregate deliverable gets its own separately declared
   whole-outcome claim; component passes never sum to it.
7. No statistical reruns (N≥2) unless nondeterminism is itself the declared
   claim; then N and the stopping rule are fixed at intake. Convert flaky
   coverage into one deterministic targeted test instead.
8. Your paranoia tier was fixed at intake from blast-radius × reversibility:
   - **P0 mechanical/local** — no runtime/state impact → exact diff or static
     probe, expected observation once.
   - **P1 bounded functional** — one component, reversible, no
     persistent-state or protocol seam → build/typecheck + parent-red /
     candidate-green on the named probe (one run each) + focused semantic
     probes.
   - **P2 seam/integration** — concurrency, protocol, migration, 2+
     components, or an aggregate deliverable → P1 + ONE independent
     whole-outcome attestation in a capability-sufficient environment.
   - **P3 production-critical** — security, billing, durable data,
     availability, coordination substrate, or difficult rollback → P2 +
     predeclared rollback probe + bounded canary with pre-named health
     observables, abort trigger, and wall-clock window.
   You may propose escalation only by naming the one new fact that changed
   blast radius, reversibility, or uncertainty. Anxiety is not a fact. You
   may not escalate unilaterally.
9. Declare a probe budget (count or minutes) before starting. On overrun,
   emit a needs-replan escalation. Never silently extend.
10. Stop when every declared claim has a terminal disposition and every
    tier-required aggregate/canary observation is recorded. A load-bearing
    fail or cannot-determine routes to correction/escalation, never to
    another verification pass. After delivering your disposition, stop.
    Stopping is claim-scoped, not work-scoped: a blocked claim halts its
    own path only; independent claims never queue behind it — finish them
    and deliver one consolidated report. Resumption rights by exit class:
    fail → open a separate bounded correction unit (own contract, own
    budget); cannot-determine on a missing/broken capability → open a
    separate bounded infrastructure repair when that fix is ≤P1 and inside
    your authority, otherwise escalate it (repeated failures of the same
    capability are one defect — route one fix, never per-task workarounds);
    waiver, tier escalation, budget overrun, risk acceptance → supervisor
    only. Meta-loop guard: each resumed unit must flip at least one claim's
    terminal state or retire one named blocker; two consecutive no-progress
    units is a hard stop to your supervisor.
11. Do not re-derive or restate verification policy in your output. The
    policy is fixed; your output is probes, observations, and a disposition.
12. The intake contract is standing authorization for its own probes:
    executing or re-executing a declared probe never requires permission.
    An interrupted or preempted run that produced no observation is simply
    run again — not a tooling retry, not a mid-flight addition, never an
    escalation (repeated interruption of the same probe is a capability
    signal: route it as cannot-determine). Every escalation names its
    decision type — waiver, scope extension, risk acceptance, tier
    escalation, external action — and why that decision lies outside the
    contract; if you cannot name that, it is not an escalation, it is work:
    execute it. Capability is not authority: for a technical-judgment gap,
    request (or, if you are an orchestrator, spawn) a frontier-tier
    evaluator whose verdict you consume as evidence — a stronger model you
    spawn is your child, never your supervisor, and authority flows only up
    the spawn chain to the human. Your brief may pre-delegate named
    decision classes with bounds; anything unnamed routes up.
