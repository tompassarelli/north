# Praxis — personal residue (canonical blocks live in orchestration)

The generic spawn-payload system — function/role, task grade, domain
requirements, topology, semantic tier, deliberation, postures, model deltas,
and the compose/elicit procedures — is CANONICAL in Orchestration:
`north:orchestration/doctrine.md` and `north:orchestration/docs/routing.md` (supporting
blocks live under `north:orchestration/docs/`). Templates are overridable defaults;
when none fits, use a fully specified bespoke composition with a reason and an
explicit `promotionCandidate` decision (false by default). The compatibility
wire keeps `composition.kind:"preset"` and `nearestPreset`. Select an exact
template when its responsibility, deliverable, done criteria, report shape,
and fixed topology/capability boundary fit. Override only task grade, domains,
tier, reasoning, or posture, with a reason, while those properties remain
unchanged. Any topology/authority change — or a different responsibility,
deliverable, done criteria, report shape, or capability boundary — requires a
complete bespoke composition. `nearestPreset` is optional and grants no
capabilities; recurrence only informs human review and never promotes a
composition automatically. Edit the blocks there; they ship to everyone, and
north's harness reads them from there at spawn time.
This directory holds only what is personal:

## Domain bootstrap (defaults by entry point)

| Domain | Path signal | Default posture | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Client delivery | `~/code/client/*` | deliver (preserve on existing code) | Deadline-real. Ladder hard: glue minimized. Confidential — no cross-references out. |
| Novel core / research | `~/code/beagle`, north core, new primitives | explore → deliver once shaped | Priors law ACTIVE: distrust fluent defaults, derive and verify. Core inversion: hand-build the deliverable. |
| Infrastructure / config | `~/code/nixos-config`, dotfiles, CI | deliver, preserve-leaning | Reproducibility rules; blast radius = every future rebuild. |
| Others' code | `~/code/reference/*` | read-only | Never edit; license check before leveraging. |

Domain sets defaults; task shape can override a default; orchestration's escape
hatch overrides everything.

## Fable self-report

`self-reports/fable.md` — historical model introspection (with §11 generic
payload and §12 compilation method + trial predictions). It is calibration
evidence, not routing policy; current provider catalogs and North availability
signals decide whether any concrete model is eligible.

## Verification override — OpenAI lanes

`verification-override-openai.md` — paste-able brief block binding the
verification doctrine
(`~/.agents/docs/verification-doctrine.md`) as
imperatives: terminal states per pass, claim contracts, tier fixed at intake,
probe budgets, stop rule. Attach to every OpenAI-provider lane doing
implementation or verification work. Demand provenance per the freeze rule:
repeated verification tarpits in unsupervised OpenAI lanes (2026-07, fram
cache work).

## Change policy — the freeze rule

Edit this structure only after a real spawn hit a misfit **twice**. Never
speculatively — no new roles, postures, domains, or deltas ahead of demand.
