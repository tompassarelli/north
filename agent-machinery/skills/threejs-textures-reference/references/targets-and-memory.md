# Render targets and resource ownership

## Decisions and rationale

Never sample a texture while rendering into that same attached target; use separate targets or ping-pong. Restore the prior render target when nesting operations. A material does not own all referenced textures by default; use explicit exclusive ownership or reference accounting before disposal.

## Reading the examples

Each block is an independent illustrative fragment, not a tested complete app.
Unless declared inside the block, scene/camera/renderer/mesh and asset variables
come from the consumer. Match APIs to the installed Three.js release. Wire only
the selected pattern into the consumer's frame and cleanup ownership.

## Render Targets

Render to texture for effects.

```javascript
// Create render target
const renderTarget = new THREE.WebGLRenderTarget(512, 512, {
  minFilter: THREE.LinearFilter,
  magFilter: THREE.LinearFilter,
  format: THREE.RGBAFormat,
});

// Render scene to target
renderer.setRenderTarget(renderTarget);
renderer.render(scene, camera);
renderer.setRenderTarget(null); // Back to screen

// Use as texture
material.map = renderTarget.texture;
```

### Depth Texture

```javascript
const renderTarget = new THREE.WebGLRenderTarget(512, 512);
renderTarget.depthTexture = new THREE.DepthTexture(
  512,
  512,
  THREE.UnsignedShortType,
);

// Access depth
const depthTexture = renderTarget.depthTexture;
```

### Multi-Sample Render Target

```javascript
const renderTarget = new THREE.WebGLRenderTarget(512, 512, {
  samples: 4, // MSAA
});
```

## Texture Memory Management

### Dispose Textures

```javascript
// Single texture
texture.dispose();

// Material textures
function disposeMaterial(material) {
  const maps = [
    "map",
    "normalMap",
    "roughnessMap",
    "metalnessMap",
    "aoMap",
    "emissiveMap",
    "displacementMap",
    "alphaMap",
    "envMap",
    "lightMap",
    "bumpMap",
    "specularMap",
  ];

  maps.forEach((mapName) => {
    if (material[mapName]) {
      material[mapName].dispose();
    }
  });

  material.dispose();
}
```

### Texture Pooling

A cache must declare sharing and disposal ownership. Cache the in-flight
promise as well as completed loads to avoid duplicate concurrent fetches.
Only evict/dispose after no borrower uses the texture; a Map alone cannot
establish that condition. Failed promises must be removed if retries are
allowed. Key by all settings affecting identity, not URL alone when color
space or sampler configuration differs.
